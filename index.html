            <h4 class="Content-heading">The Mass Effect</h4>
            <p class="Content">
              The Mass Effect franchise was gigantic for the Xbox 360 era, but it
              didn't transfer to future platforms well — purchasing and downloading
              the entire story became confusing and expensive when moving to the Xbox
              One and Xbox Series X. But 2021's Legendary Edition finally made the
              entire Mass Effect trilogy accessible in one package.<br />

              The story follows Commander Shepard, a futuristic military hero, who's
              tasked with gathering a collection of alien misfits for a variety of
              missions. Each game is wonderfully crafted, with stand-alone stories and
              breakout characters that don't rely on the series' wider narrative. As a
              trilogy, the games build on each other with meaningful choices that
              carry over to the next entry, giving weight to your choices.<br />
              The Legendary Edition is the way to experience Mass Effect, and it's a
              must-play whether you're on your first run to save the galaxy or your
              fifth. —RG Mass Effect Legendary Edition is available via Game Pass on
              Windows PC<br />

            <p class="Content">
              e Xbox brand might never have taken off without the Halo series, the
              first-person shooters that helped to popularize local competitive
              multiplayer on consoles before taking the party online after the launch
              of Xbox Live. The Master Chief Collection package includes multiple Halo
              games, all of which have been updated to keep them enjoyable for modern
              audiences.<br />
              But what's so striking about the collection is how many ways there are
              to play. You can go through the campaigns by yourself. If you want to
              play with a friend but don't want to compete, there is co-op, allowing
              you to share the games' stories with a partner, either online or through
              split-screen play. If you do want to compete, you can do it locally
              against up to three other players on the same TV, or take things online
              to challenge the wider community.<br />
              These are some of the best first-person shooters ever released, and
              they're worth revisiting and enjoying, no matter how you decide to play
              them. Sharing these games with my children through local co-op has been
              an amazing journey, and this package includes so many games, each of
              which is filled with different modes and options. It's hard to imagine
              ever getting bored or uninstalling the collection once it's on your hard
              drive.<br />
              This is a part of gaming history that continues to feel relevant, and
              very much alive. —Ben Kucher Halo: The Master Chief Collection is
              available via Game Pass on Windows PC,

            <p class="Content">
              Forza Horizon 5 is the latest racing game to land on Xbox and Game Pass.
              It's a visual feast filled with some of the most realistic-looking cars
              you've ever seen. But anyone who loves any of these Forza games will
              tell you that the Horizon series is so much more than its graphics.<br />
              Horizon 5 takes place in a fictionalized Mexico, and gives you the
              freedom to drive around a massive map in whatever car you want. You can
              drive a nice sports car while off-roading, or drive a hummer off a
              massive ramp.<br />
              Forza Horizon 5 gives you the freedom and choice to drive how and where
              you want inside a legion of incredible cars. —RG<br />

            <h4 class="Content-heading">Assasins Creed : Origins</h4>
            <p class="Content">
              Assassin's Creed Origins has always been good — but it was only in
              hindsight, three years after its release, that I began to consider it
              great. It's a phenomenal concoction of historical tourism, sci-fi
              storytelling, and open-ended combat. It also displays a confidence that
              the more recent Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla
              can only partially match. Whereas the two most recent entries embrace
              the insecure ethos of “content” that has so defined the last decade of
              open-world games, Origins is content to leave vast swaths of its world
              empty and to let things burn slowly, in ways both narrative and
              explorative.<br />
              Its map unfurls over deserts, mountains, oases, and sun-swept cities
              slowly being buried in sand, all while its two central figures (Bayek
              and Aya) navigate one of video games' most compelling romances.<br />
              It's not completely averse to daily challenges and cosmetic DLC packs.
              But it's the rare open-world game that trusts my attention span. It
              understands that pastoral beauty and tragic storytelling, successfully
              interwoven, are worth more than any number of distractions its
              successors can throw at me. —Mike Mahardy

            <h4 class="Content-heading">HIFI Rush</h4>
            <p class="Content">
              Rhythm games, for players who prefer to shoot, dodge, punch, and jump on
              their own time, can be a tough sell. But such is not the case with Hi-Fi
              Rush, the action game from Ghostwire: Tokyo developer Tango
              Gameworks.<br />
              It provides an array of visual cues to help rhythmically challenged
              players, but crucially, it doesn't require that protagonist Chai attacks
              according to the game's metronome. Instead, its rhythm elements are an
              optional layer to interact with, offering score chasers something to
              aspire to. For everyone else, the game's vibrant world, rock n' roll
              storytelling, and entrancing traversal stand well enough on their
              own.<br />
              It's a cathartic triumph of a game. —MM<br />

          <h4 class="Content-heading">PowerWash Simulator</h4>
          <p class="Content">
            PowerWash Simulator is the perfect game to sit on your couch and space
            off to. As the name suggests, you're a professional power washer, and
            your job is to use your washing tools to obliterate grease, grime, and
            goop off of vehicles, buildings, and even entire playgrounds.<br />
            There are some minor upgrade and currency systems, but PowerWash
            Simulator mostly takes a minimalistic approach — you power wash stuff,
            no more, no less. Sure, you can take special jobs where you wash
            something wild like a Mars rover, but it's really just about making
            things clean. And while it might sound like boring yard work, it's
            actually quite meditative.<br />
            Blasting the black film off of a colorful slide provided me with one of
            the biggest serotonin bursts I've gotten from any piece of media in
            years. It's a delightful, peaceful game that never fails to relax me
            after a long week. —RG<br />
